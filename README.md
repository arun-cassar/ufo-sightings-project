# About this project  
In this short project, I used Python to analyse a Kaggle dataset on UFO sightings. The goals for this project included:  
- Correctly load a data file and inspect it
- Clean the dataset by filtering out missing values
- Carry out exploratory data analysis
- Use matplotlib to visualise the findings
